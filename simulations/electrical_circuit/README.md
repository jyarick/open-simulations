# Electrical Circuit Simulation (Series RC Visualizer)

## Overview

An interactive physics visualization of a **series RC circuit** built using Python and Turtle graphics.

This project simulates capacitor charging and discharging while visualizing:

- current flow
- capacitor voltage
- charge accumulation
- equivalent resistance and capacitance
- the RC time constant

The goal is to provide an **intuitive and educational view of transient circuit behavior**.

## Features

- Interactive **series RC circuit simulation**
- Visual circuit layout with:
  - battery
  - resistors
  - capacitors
  - current flow indicators
- Real-time simulation of:
  - capacitor voltage \(V_C\)
  - current \(I\)
  - charge \(Q\)
- Adjustable **simulation playback speed**
- Toggle between **charging and discharging modes**
- Numerical solver with **analytic solution comparison**
- Post-simulation plots for validation

## Physics Model

The simulation solves the standard RC differential equation.

### Charging

\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt} = \frac{V_{source}-V_C}{RC}
\]

\[
V_C(t)=V_{source} + (V_C(0)-V_{source})e^{-t/\tau}
\]

### Discharging

\[
\frac{dV_C}{dt} = -\frac{V_C}{RC}
\]

\[
V_C(t)=V_C(0)e^{-t/\tau}
\]

Where

\[
\tau = RC
\]

is the **time constant** of the circuit.

## How to Run

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/circuit-sim.git

Navigate into the directory

cd circuit-sim

Run the simulation

python3 main.py
```
After the visual simulation ends, plots of:

- capacitor voltage
- current
- charge

will be displayed.

## Educational Purposes

This project was built as an educational tool for understanding transient circuit behavior.

The goal is to connect mathematical circuit models with visual intuition.

Students can explore:

- how resistance and capacitance affect charging rate
- how the RC time constant shapes transient response
- how current decays as the capacitor charges
